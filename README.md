# CardGame
This program will generate random cards for the user to select. The user selects 3 random cards out of 5 options in order to generate the sum of the card 'values'. The user will click a button to reveal the CPU's cards, which also have been randomized and will also print the sum of the CPU's values. The biggest sum of the 2 is the winner of the game
